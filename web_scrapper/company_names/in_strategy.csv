The company is now ahead of its Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) commitment to reduce annual GHG emissions by 50% by 2030.,"Discrepancy in the earlier press release (https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2021/april/thomson-reuters-ahead-of-schedule-on-climate-change-targets.html)  and company's current stance on climate change (found here: https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/social-impact/our-world/thomson-reuters-climate-change.html). The company does not mention its commitment to net zero in its position on climate change, which it does in the press release. 
Update on climate change targets
In 2020, Thomson Reuters joined the Science Based Targets initiative, committing to reduce Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2018 baseline levels, as well as reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, business travel, and employee commuting by 25% by 2025 from 2019 baseline levels. Additionally, Thomson Reuters aims to require 65% of suppliers by spend to have Science Based Targets by 2025.
This year, we report an update on those goals. Largely through investment in renewable power for our facilities, we’ve been able to drive more than a 93% reduction in GHG emissions from our 2018 baseline. To date, business travel emissions are 91% lower than our 2019 baseline, and we have made progress on our engagement target with our supply chain, with 27% of suppliers by spend committed to Science Based Targets. In addition to the switch to renewable energy, Thomson Reuters is carbon neutral through offsetting the remaining portion of its GHG footprint through carbon offsets, and we continue to refine our procurement process to incentivize working with suppliers who share our commitment to sustainability.

regenerative agriculture and reforestation. Based on guidance and precedents set by internationally recognized organizations,
such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and in alignment with the NZBA and PCAF, CIBC will only accept portfolio
companies’ use of carbon dioxide removal credits from projects that have been verified in accordance with standard GHG
accounting protocols and registered on a recognized platform.
The inclusion of carbon dioxide removals creates opportunities for our clients to complement their reduction efforts and reduce
their overall emissions intensities. Currently, third-party carbon reduction offsets unrelated to removals projects are not recognized

Reduced GHG emissions and energy associated with

2011 as a baseline, exceeding the 5% reduction target
we had established (Pg.36).

In 2018, two of its group companies mention their own emission reduction target (Pg. 86):
""Great-West Lifeco has a strong commitment to minimizing its environmental impact, to reporting highquality emissions data and reducing emissions across its operations. In 2017, the company strengthened
this commitment by establishing long-term GHG emission reduction targets for its Canadian properties,
specifically 27 per cent by 2025 and 50 per cent by 2036. Throughout the year, its property and asset
management teams worked collaboratively toward these goals, implementing realistic and economically
feasible projects to reduce the company’s carbon footprint, such as building equipment retrofits, data centre optimizations
and operational enhancements. Between 2013 and 2017, the company achieved a 17.7 per cent reduction in GHG emissions
in its managed real estate portfolio.""

""IGM Financial is also committed to transparency and accountability on climate issues. As such, in 2017, IGM Financial
obtained a score of A- (Leadership) as part of the 2017 CDP survey, ranking in the top five financial services companies in
Canada for the fourth year in a row. IGM Financial has set short- and long-term GHG emission reduction targets using 2013
as a base year. The objective is to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from energy use at owned
assets by 2020 (Scope 1 and 2) and to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from energy use at
owned assets by 2036 (Scope 1 and 2). Thanks to its various energy efficiency projects underway and its strategy of
purchasing renewable energy for its owned office building, the company’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased
substantially, representing a 66 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2013 to 2017.""

The company has the same target from 2015 till 2021, despite 2020 being the target year.
