it moves to procure renewable energy for electricity energy
needs, the number of offsets required for Scope 2 emissions may
decrease in future.
This year, Wheaton expanded its boundary of reporting to include
Scope 3 attributable emissions from its mining partners. Instead of
offsetting these emissions, Wheaton will be focused on engaging
with mining partners to drive down these emissions in order to
achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Although Wheaton’s
focus is shifting towards emissions reductions, offsets will continue
to play a role, and may also be used in 2050 for any residual
emissions.
